The system includes typical sensors used for water and air quality monitoring i.e, pH, EC, temperature and humidity meters. These in turn are responsible for triggering the activation of mechanical devices, such as pumps and fans. The significance of pumps lies not only in delivering water to the growing channels but also in dispensing the necessary nutrients automatically.
