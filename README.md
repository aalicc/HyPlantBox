# HyPlantBox!
HyPlantBox! project represents a user-friendly IoT-based hydroponic system controlled by an automation box. This system features a web-based user interface, enabling users to both monitor and adjust vital system parameters with ease. Originating from the students' Innovation Project (see "innoproject" repository) , this project received financial support of UrbanFarmLab and Metropolia UAS, underscoring its potential for practical greenhouse applications.

<br />In our system CONTROLLINO MAXI is the brain, and Raspberry Pi is giving it orders.

The system includes typical sensors used for water and air quality monitoring i.e, pH, EC, temperature and humidity meters. These in turn are responsible for triggering the activation of mechanical devices, such as pumps and fans.
